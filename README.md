# Getting Started with Student App

To start the backed, use 

### `node server.js`

It will start for the port 5000. I've allowed access only to that port in CORS so please make sure the port is available. 

Start the front end as you would start any react app. It is located in the client. 

### `cd client`
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
