# Getting Started with Student App

To start the backed, use 

### `node server.js`

It will start in the port 5000. 

Start the front end as you would start any react app. It is located in the client. 

### `cd client`
### `npm start`

I've allowed access only to port 3000 in CORS so please make sure the port is available else it will not work. 

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
