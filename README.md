# Running Student App

To install all the dependencies please do 

### `npm install`

To start the backed, use 

### `node server.js`

It will start in the port 5000. 

Start the front end as you would start any react app. It is located in the client. 

### `cd client`
### `npm start`

I've allowed access only to port 3000 in CORS so please make sure the port is available else it will not work. If something else is block the port it will give its PID.

You may kill the process by 

### kill [PID]

Run the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
